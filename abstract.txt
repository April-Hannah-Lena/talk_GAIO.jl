GAIO (Global Analysis of Invariant Objects) is a software package for set oriented computations in dynamical systems. These include isolating attractors, discretizing invariant measures and computing their transfer behaviors, among others. The algorithms that make up GAIO have been rebuilt from the ground up using the Julia programming language: a fast, open-source, elegant language and framework which still feels familiar to users of Matlab, Python, or Lisp. An introduction of GAIO.jl's functionality is presented using interactive examples.
